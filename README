*** Mission statement ***

I2PP is an implementation of the I2P network/protocol in C++. It
strives to be fully compatible with the existing I2P router.

I2PP does NOT intend to compete with I2P nor does it intend to
change protocols and standards given by I2P. The purpose of this
project is only to push the author's knowledge of networking,
anonymity and crytpography.

If indeed you want to push the I2P project, I strongly recommend
to support the official Java-based I2P implementation.

I2PP is able to run on multiple platforms, with focus on Linux first
and Windows second.

The general roadmap of i2pp can be found in the ROADMAP file
The TODO file contains the next planned tasks, while the ROADMAP
file contains a broader plan about the implementation plan.

If someone wants to start helping this project (despite my note
above), information on how to get started can be found in the
DEVELOP file.

*** Tools ***

I2PP uses existing tools and libaries to achieve its goals:

- Qt: an excellent and powerfull cross-platform framework by
  Nokia. http://www.qtsoftware.com, together with Qt Creator,
  a multi-platfrom IDE.

- Crypto++: used for all cryptographic needs, like hashing,,
  encryption, key exchangine, etc. http://www.cryptopp.com/

- log4cxx: a popular logging environment for C++.

- Wt: to create the webinterface to the router's administration.

*** Who I am ***

I'm known as 'sirup' in the i2p network. I ported Gnutella client
Phex to the I2P network, still known and working as I2Phex.
