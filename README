*** Mission statement ***

I2PP is an implementation of the I2P network/protocol in C++. It
strives to be fully compatible with the existing I2P router,
which is written in Java.

I2PP does NOT intend to compete with I2P nor does it intend to
stray protocols and standards given by I2P. The purpose of this
project is only to push the author's knowledge of networking,
anonymity and crytpography.

I2PP is able to run on multiple platforms, mainly Linux and Windows,
but focuses on Linux foremost.

I2PP uses existing tools and libaries to achieve its goals:

- Qt: an excellent and powerfull cross-platform framework by
  Nokia. http://www.qtsoftware.com

- Crypto++: used for all cryptographic needs, like hashing,,
  encryption, key exchangine, etc. http://www.cryptopp.com/

- log4cplus: a popular logging environment for C++,

- Wt: to create the webinterface to the router's administration.

*** Who I am ***

I'm know as 'sirup' in the i2p network. I created the original
port of the Gnutella client Phex to the I2P network, still known
and working as I2Phex.
