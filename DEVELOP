Before doing anything, make sure to get a basic
understanding of i2p and how it works at the
introductions and technical documents at
http://www.i2p2.de/

It would also make sense to have a look at the
existing java code of i2p, as i2pp will be heavily
based on this code base.

And as mentioned in the mission statement: your
work is most probably better spend on the i2p
project directly.

Fast way
====================================================
- install QT creator on your system
- get sources from github, project i2pp
- open i2pp.pro in QTcreator
- go from there

What the heck?
====================================================
More detailes description will follow, if ever the
need will arise.
